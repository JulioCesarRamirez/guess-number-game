# Guess number app
This app is built at React-native with Typescript.

## How the game works

You have to input a number, then another player will guess what is that number previously inputted. In the screens below there is one with 2 buttons - and + where player 2 will press those buttons until he guesses the number. 

There is history below where all the tries are placed. When player two finally guesses the number another screen is displayed to start a new game.
